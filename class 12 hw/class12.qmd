> Question 13

How many samples do we have?
```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```
```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

> Question 14

Let's make a boxplot

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno, exp, fill= geno) + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
```

A/A has the highest median expression but has more variability while G/G has the lowest median expression but the least variability. The SNP does influence the expression of ORMDL3 because the A/A has higher expression while G/G has lower expression, which suggests that the G allele is associated with having a lower gene expression.
