## The PDB Database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at: https//www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this databse contains. I went to PDB \> analyze \> PDB statistics \> By Exp method & molecular type.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric. I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()` function:

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
as.numeric( sub(",", "", x) )
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function.

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so that they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them.

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of X-ray structures

```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Total number of structures:

```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

Percent of X-ray structures

```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```

Percent of EM structures

```{r}
sum(df$em)
```

```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total) * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
protein_only <- sum(df$total[df$molecular_type == "Protein (only)"])
protein_oligosaccharide <- sum(df$total[df$molecular_type == "Protein/Oligosaccharide"])
protein_na <- sum(df$total[df$molecular_type == "Protein/NA"])

protein_only
protein_oligosaccharide
protein_na
```

```{r}
protein_sum <- protein_only + protein_oligosaccharide + protein_na
protein_sum/sum(df$total)
```

> Q3. Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

4683 structures

## 2. Using Mol\*

The main Mol\* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/ We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code)

## Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7. How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

```{r}
length( pdbseq(pdb) )
```

> Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues?

MK1

> Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure?

2 Chains, A & B

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package:

```{r}
library(r3dmol)
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink")
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
